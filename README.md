Project Relevance

In today’s digital world, the security of personal information has become more critical than ever. With the continuous advancement of technology, the risk of data leaks increases, emphasizing the importance of secure communication and file storage. Inspired by Telegram’s approach to security and convenience, we aim to create a messaging platform that not only offers secure communication but also provides users with advanced file management features.

In Kazakhstan, there is a limited selection of localised solutions focused on privacy and customisation to meet national needs. Our goal is to develop an application that combines international security standards with local relevance, addressing the need for both secure communication and efficient file management.
Competitor Analysis

Several popular messengers are available in Kazakhstan, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. However, most of them either lack full localisation or fail to prioritise data security adequately.
WhatsApp

    Strengths: Large user base (over 2 billion users globally).
    Weaknesses: Limited privacy controls, user data may be shared with Meta companies.
    Advantage of Our Messenger: Flexible system for controlling access to files and personal information.

Telegram

    Strengths: Extensive functionality (channels, bots, saved messages).
    Weaknesses: Advertisements, which can be avoided by purchasing a Premium subscription.
    Advantage of Our Messenger: Simplified interface for privacy settings.

Signal

    Strengths: Minimal user data collection (no activity logs, contacts, or metadata).
    Weaknesses: Outdated and less visually appealing interface.
    Advantage of Our Messenger: Modern, intuitive design.

Conclusion
