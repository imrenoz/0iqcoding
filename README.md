Topic: Social Network	


Project relevance
The modern world requires a high level of security for personal information. With the development of technology, users are increasingly faced with the risk of data leakage, which makes the security of communication and file storage paramount. We were inspired by Telegram's approach, which has become a benchmark of security and convenience for users around the world. However, in Kazakhstan, there remains a limited choice of localised solutions focused on privacy and customisation to national needs.

We chose this topic to create an application that will not only provide secure communication, but also offer users convenient file management functionality. The project aims to be a new stage in the development of secure communications, combining local accessibility with international security standards.

Weaknesses: Limited privacy controls: user data may be shared with Meta companies.
Advantage of our messenger: A more flexible system for controlling access to files and personal information.

Telegram
Strengths: Extensive functionality: channels, bots, saved messages.
Weaknesses: Advetisements: can be solved by purchasing Premium subscription
Advantage of our messenger: Simplified interface for privacy settings. 




Signal
Strengths: Minimal user data: activity logs, contacts and other metadata are not collected.
Weaknesses: Outdated and less attractive interface.
